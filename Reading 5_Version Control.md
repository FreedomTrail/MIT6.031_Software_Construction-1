# Reading: Version Control

reference: http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp18/classes/05-version-control/

### Summary

How does version control relate to the three big ideas of 6.031?

- Safe from bugs
    - find when and where something broke 
    - look for other, similar mistakes 
    - gain confidence that code hasnâ€™t changed accidentally
- Easy to understand
    - why was a change made? 
    - what else was changed at the same time? 
    - who can I ask about this code?
- Ready for change
    - all about managing and organizing changes 
    - accept and integrate changes from other developers 
    - isolate speculative work on branches
